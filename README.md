# PandaResampler

## DESCRIPTION

PandaResampler is a fast C++ (SSEified) factor 2 resampler for audio signals.
It is easy to integrate into projects since it supports header only mode.

PandaResampler is currently *experimental* which means that right now there
still can be changes that break backward compatibility.
